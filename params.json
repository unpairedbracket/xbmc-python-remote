{"name":"XBMC Remote","body":"![XBMC](http://xbmc.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/confluence-horizontal.jpg)\r\n\r\nA simple program for remote controlling xbmc installations, written in Python and using the new JSON API\r\n\r\n### How Does it work?\r\nXBMC Remote connects to XBMC (locally or over a network) over TCP and sends and receives data according to [the JSON-RPC API](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=JSON-RPC_API/v4)\r\n\r\n### What can it do?\r\nAt the moment it can control playback and list the library. It supports XBMC Dharma and (partially) Eden. It can be controlled by the MPRIS D-Bus interface, for instance by Ubuntu Unity's sound menu and several Gnome Shell extensions.\r\n\r\n### Getting XBMC Remote\r\nOn Ubuntu, it's easy. Just add my ppa to your software sources and install `xbmcremote`\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo add-apt-repository\r\n$ sudo apt-get update\r\n$ sudo apt-get install xbmcremote\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nWritten by Ben Spiers (@NamelessOne2345) using Rick Spencer's `Quickly` RAD framework","tagline":"Control XBMC remotely.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
